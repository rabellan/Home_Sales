# Home_Sales
Module 22 Challenge: SparkSQL

For this challenge, I used my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

## Questions to answer:

1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

2. What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

3. What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
